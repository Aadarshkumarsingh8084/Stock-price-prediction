<p>Stock price prediction involves forecasting the future value of a stock based on historical data, market trends, and various influencing factors. It is widely used in financial markets to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions </p>

<p>There are two primary approaches to stock price prediction:</p>

<p>Fundamental Analysis – Evaluates a company's financial health, earnings, assets, and macroeconomic factors to determine its intrinsic value.
Technical Analysis – Uses historical price and volume data to identify patterns and trends that help predict future price movements.</p>

<p>With advancements in technology, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Linear Regression, have significantly improved prediction accuracy. These models analyze large datasets, detect complex patterns, and provide better forecasting insights </p>

<p>However, stock markets are influenced by unpredictable factors like economic policies, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment, making stock price prediction inherently uncertain. While AI-driven models enhance decision-making, no prediction method guarantees absolute accuracy.Would you like a more technical explanation or a breakdown of specific prediction techniques? </p>
